<h1>‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è Lets Play Big Two ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è</h1>

<p>A multiplayer big two game.</p> 


üöß Currently under development, there is still a few things [to do](TODO.md) for v1 üöß

---

## Local development

Install deps

```
npm i
```

Setup db tables

```
npm run db:migrate
```

Start dev server

```
npm run dev
```

### DB changes

All DB schemas can be found at `/drizzle/schemas`. During development iterations it's ok to use `npm run db:push` to quickly make db changes. Once changes are ready, run `npm run db:generate` to create DB migration file. This will be run when then app deployed.

## Deployment

This application its currently run as a single VM instance on fly.io. Due to way real-time is implemented it can only be scaled vertically! This is a deliberate design decision to keep this whole application self contained on a single node for portability. In theory we could run this on VPS somewhere too!

To manually deploy this app run

```
fly deploy
```
